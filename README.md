# Semantic and Sentiment Analysis of Bhagavad Gita Translations
This project performs semantic and sentiment analysis on selected English translations of the Bhagavad Gita using a BERT-based language framework. The translations analyzed include works by Eknath Easwaran, Mahatma Gandhi, and Shri Purohit Swami. The study reveals insights into the emotional and semantic dimensions of these spiritual texts.

# Project Overview
The Bhagavad Gita, originally written in Sanskrit, presents philosophical teachings through the dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. Translations of the text often differ due to the translator's interpretations and the challenges of preserving rhythm and meaning.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models to analyze:

Sentiment Analysis: Identifying recurring emotional themes across translations.
Semantic Analysis: Exploring similarities and variations in meaning among the translations.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Converting PDF files of translations into text.
Cleaning and tokenizing the text.
Standardizing modern equivalents for archaic language.
Modeling:

Sentiment Analysis: Multi-label classification using the BERT model trained on the SenWave dataset.
Semantic Analysis: Sentence similarity using MPNet and keyword extraction with KeyBERT.
Evaluation:

Visualizing results through heatmaps, bar charts, and similarity scores.
Assessing differences and commonalities in sentiments and semantics across translations.

# Results
Sentiment analysis highlighted recurring emotional themes, such as a shift from pessimism to optimism in Arjuna's journey.
Semantic analysis revealed consistent keyword importance and comparable meanings across translations despite linguistic differences.

# Future Work
Extend the framework to include translations in other languages and texts like the Upanishads.
Collaborate with Sanskrit experts to validate findings.
Explore preservation of rhythm and rhyme in translations.
